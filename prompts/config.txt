Given two tables — an extracted table and a ground truth table — provide an accuracy estimate that rigorously compares the numerical values, including their signs (positive or negative), and evaluates the associated extracted fields for accuracy.

<</SYS>>

<UserInput>
Table 1: {curr_df}
Table 2: {doc_df}
</UserInput>

Output Instructions:

1. Evaluate the accuracy between 1-100. If one table has more rows than the other, ignore the extra rows in your comparison.
2. Set accuracy to 0 if one table is present and the other is absent, as there is no basis for comparison.
3. An accuracy score of 0 indicates a complete mismatch, while 100 indicates perfect accuracy, including the precise match of numerical signs and fields.
4. Provide a concise justification for the score, focusing on the accuracy of numerical values including the correctness of their signs (positive or negative) and the accuracy of associated fields.

Output Example:

Accuracy: 92

The accuracy score is 92 because both tables display a high degree of similarity in their numerical values and associated fields. However, there were minor discrepancies in the signs of some numbers which impacted the score.
