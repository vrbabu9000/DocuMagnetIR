The standard of academic conduct for Stanford students is as follows:
1. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the students, individually and collectively: a. that they will not give or receive aid in examinations; that they will not give or receive unpermitted aid in class work, in the preparation of reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the instructor as the basis of grading; b. that they will do their share and take an active part in seeing to it that they as well as others uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code.
2. The faculty on its part manifests its confidence in the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring examinations and from taking unusual and unreasonable precautions to prevent the forms of dishonesty mentioned above. The faculty will also avoid, as far as practicable, academic procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code.
3. While the faculty alone has the right and obligation to set academic requirements, the students and faculty will work together to establish optimal conditions for honorable academic work.

\section{$2$ Short Answers $1$ (10 pts)}
1. [2pts] Consider a collection with one billion tokens (i.e., with $10^{9}$ tokens). Suppose the first $1,000$ of these tokens results in a vocabulary size of $1,000$ terms, and the first $100,000$ tokens results in a vocabulary size of $10,000$ terms. Use Heap's law to estimate the vocabulary size of the whole collection.
2. [2pts] For a conjunctive query, is processing postings lists in increasing order of their lengths guaranteed to be optimal execution order? Explain why it is, or give an example where it isn't.
3. [2pts] In one sentence, why are pairwise ranking approaches more successful for learning to rank search results than classification or regression approaches?
4. [2pts] For learning search engine rankings, what are two problems with adopting a straightforward approach of minimizing pairwise ranking errors, which have been studied and corrected in subsequent research?
a)
b)
5. [2pts] In the Binary Independency Model, the retrieval status value formula for each query term $i$ contains the fraction $\left(1-r_{i}\right) / r_{i}$ where $r_{i}=\left(n_{i}-s_{i}\right) /(N-S)$. Here, $n_{i}$ is the total number of documents containing the term $i$, of which $s_{i}$ documents are relevant to the query. $N$ is the total number of documents in the collection, of which $S$ documents are relevant.

It was suggested that this quantity $\log \left(1-r_{i}\right) / r_{i}$ can be well approximated by the IDF for term $i=\log N / n_{i}$. What are the two assumptions necessary to get this result?
a)
b)

1. [1pt] What is the largest number that can be stored in $4$ bytes using unary encoding?
2. [2pts] Many systems, e.g., Lucene, provide a separate function to index a set of documents in bulk, instead of just one document? What do you think is an advantage of such a function?
3. [3pts] Assume that postings lists are gap encoded using $\gamma$ codes. Using this encoding, suppose that the postings list for the term information is the bit sequence:

Assume that the dictionary data structure used for this index stores the actual terms using dictionary-as-a-string storage with front coding and a block size of $3$.

\section{$4$ Clustering (10 pts)}
1. [4pts] Calculate purity and Rand Index of the following two clusterings. $D_{i}$ 's are documents and $C_{i}$ 's are classes. (Purity of a clustering is an average of purity of individual clusters.) The true labels of the documents are:

\section{$5$ Link Analysis (10 pts)}

Given a collection of text, consider a Markov Chain $M$ built as follows. We have one state for each term in the collection. The transition probability from any state $t_{1}$ to another $t_{2}$ is the fraction (in the text collection) of times that term $t_{1}$ is immediately followed by term $t_{2}$. We only have states for dictionary terms; ignore start/end-of-string markers/symbols.

Consider the text: a rose is a rose is a rose
1. $[2 \mathrm{pts}]$ Draw the corresponding Markov Chain $M$.
2. [1pt] Is $M$ ergodic?
3. [1pt] We now augment $M$ with a teleportation operation, to create a new Markov Chain $M_{1}$. At each step of $M_{1}$, we follow $M$ with probability $87 \%$, while with probability $13 \%$ we jump to a random state. Is $M_{1}$ ergodic?
4. [3pts] Compute the stationary distribution of $M_{1}$.
5. [1pt] Is the vector of stationary probabilities of $M_{1}$ the same as the vector of fractions of occurrences for each term in the text of part (1)?
6. [2pts] Show where the addition of a single word in the text of part (1) would change the answer in part (5) to the question: are the two vectors the same?

\section{$6 \quad$ SVM ( $10 \mathrm{pts}$ )}

We are training an SVM classifier on this small training data set of $4$ points:
\begin{tabular}{llll}
$(2,0)$ & Class A & $(2,2)$ & Class not-A \\
$(0,2)$ & Class A & $(4,4)$ & Class not-A
\end{tabular}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_04_23_d08c2935fd2ba9bb5e93g-07.jpg?height=570&width=681&top_left_y=550&top_left_x=302)

Let the class A correspond to $y_{i}=+1$.
1. $[1 \mathrm{pt}]$ Is this data linearly separable?
2. [1pt] What is the (geometric) margin for a hard-margin SVM on this data?
3. [2pts] Write an equation for the optimal separating hyperplane for a hard-margin SVM trained on this data. Work out the answer geometrically, based on the data points above.
4. [1pt] What is the SVM decision function (giving the class assignment)?
5. [2pts] For the algebraic formulation, we impose the standard constraint that $\mathbf{w}^{T} \mathbf{x}_{i}+b \geq 1$ if $y_{i}=1$ and $\mathbf{w}^{T} \mathbf{x}_{i}+b \leq-1$ if $y_{i}=-1$, and then proceed to minimize $\|w\|$. What weight vector $\mathbf{w}$ and corresponding $b$ achieves this?
6. [1pt] What is the name of the quantity calculated by $2 /\|\mathbf{w}\|$ and what is its value here?
7. [2pts] Consider now a soft-margin SVM, where the value of $C$ is not too high, so that one but only one point will be moved with a slack variable, as far as needed to maximize the margin (concretely, $C=0.1$ will achieve this effect given this data, but you don't need to use this value to answer the question). What will the SVM decision function be now, and what is the margin?

\section{$7$ Evaluation (12 pts)}
1. [2pts] In the class, we discussed several ways to evaluate ranking systems, for e.g., precision, recall, NDCG etc. However, for all these metrics, we need the relevance values for the results. Two possible methods to collect relevance values, as mentioned in class, are: a) click feedback from users, b) expert judgements (like what we did for the search ratings task for PA3). Write one advantage and one disadvantage of each of these methods.
a) Click feedback:
b) Expert judgments:
2. [1pt] An alternative method to evaluate ranking systems is to do a pairwise comparison of two ranking systems instead of evaluating an individual system, i.e. if you have two ranking systems A and B, instead of evaluating them independently, you can perform the same query on both systems and compare the results. Write why this might give better results than evaluating individual systems independently.
3. [3pts] One such method, which uses click feedback to compare two ranking systems, is balanced interleaving. Given a query $q$, it combines the results, $A=\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots\right)$ of the first system and $B=\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots\right)$ of the second system, into one consolidated ranking, $I$ as shown in Algorithm 1. Note that this is a simple merge algorithm which breaks ties using a random coin toss (done once at the beginning).
```
Algorithm $1$ Balanced Interleaving
Input: Rankings $A=(a 1 ; a 2 ; \ldots)$ and $B=(b 1 ; b 2 ; \ldots)$
$I:=() ; / / o u t p u t$ ranking list, initialized to empty list
$k_{a}:=1 ; k_{b}:=1 ; / /$ counters for the lists A and B , respectively
AFirst $:=$ randomly select $0$ or $1 / /$ decide which ranking gets priority
while $\left(k_{a}<=|A|\right.$ and $\left.k_{b}<=|B|\right)$ do //if not at end of A or B
    if $\left(k_{a}<k_{b}\right.$ or $\left(k_{a}==k_{b}\right.$ and AFirst $\left.==1\right)$ ) then
        if $A\left[k_{a}\right] \notin I$ then $I$.append $\left(A\left[k_{a}\right]\right) / /$ append a result from A
        $k_{a}:=k_{a}+1$
    else
        if $B\left[k_{b}\right] \notin I$ then $I$.append $\left(B\left[k_{b}\right]\right) / /$ append a result from B
        $k_{b}:=k_{b}+1$
    end if
end while
Output: Interleaved ranking $I=\left(i_{1} ; i_{2} ; \ldots\right)$
```

\section{If the two input ranking lists are:}

\section{A: (a; b; c; d; g; h) B: (b; e; a; f; g; h)}
what is the output ranking $I$ (if A wins the toss, i.e., AFirst $=1$ )?
4. [3pts] When the user enters a query $q$ in the search engine, the back end merges the results of the two systems A and B using Algorithm 1, and the user is presented with the output list $I$. The user then clicks on one or more of the results, and these clicks are used to figure out which ranking, A or B , is preferred by the user.

Formally, let $\left(c_{1} ; c_{2} ; \ldots\right)$ be the ranks of the clicks w.r.t. $I$ and $c_{\max }$ be the rank of the lowest clicked link, (with $i_{\text {cmax }}$ being the corresponding result in list $I$ ), i.e., if the user clicks on the $1^{s t}, 3^{r d}$ and $7^{\text {th }}$ link, $c_{\max }=7$. Let, $k=\min \left\{j:\left(i_{c \max }=a_{j}\right) \vee\left(i_{c \max }=b_{j}\right)\right\}$; we find how many clicked results occur in the top $k$ results for each list.

For example, if the lowest link clicked by the user on $I$ corresponds to the $5^{t h}$ result in A and $7^{\text {th }}$ result in B , then $\mathrm{k}=5$ and we'll look at the number of clicked results present in the top $5$ results of A and B . To derive a preference between A and B , we simply compare the number of clicks in the top k results of A and B , i.e., if more results from A are clicked, then A is preferred.

In the example lists given in part $3$ above, which system, $A$ or $B$, is preferred if the user clicks on the $1^{\text {st }}$ and $4^{\text {th }}$ link in the output $I$ ? Explain your answer.
5. [3pts] Now, consider a bot which clicks on the results presented by the search engine uniformly at random, i.e., each link is equally likely to be clicked by the bot. Write an example of input lists A, B so that such a random clicker generates a strict preference for one of the lists in expectation. Is this a problem? Why or why not?

\section{$8$ Vector Space Models (8 pts)}

Consider the following retrieval scheme:
Eg. for a query rising interest rates
- Run the query as a phrase query
- If $<K$ docs contain the phrase rising interest rates, run two phrase queries rising interest and interest rates
- If we still have $<K$ docs, run the vector space query rising interest rates. Rank matching docs by vector space scoring

Consider the following set of documents:
D1 : Do you like green eggs and ham
D2 : I do not like them Sam I am
D3 : I do not like green eggs and ham
D4 : I do not like eggs
D5 : Why are they green
Let the query be green eggs and suppose we eventually want to show the user $4$ documents. That is, $K=4$.
1. [2pts] Run the phrase query green eggs. What are the documents that get retrieved in this step?
2. [2pts] What are the scores of the documents you retrieved in part (1) for the phrase query using cosine similarity on a bigram vector space ?
3. [4pts] If you did not have K documents in the first step, continue scoring according to the technique. What are the final $4$ documents that you return and their scores)?

\section{$9$ Ranking (8 pts)}

BM25 is a measure of how relevant a document is for a query. Below is the formula for Okapi BM25:
$$R S V^{B M 25}=\sum_{i \in q}\left(\log \frac{N}{d f_{i}}\right) \frac{\left(k_{1}+1\right) t f_{i}}{k_{1}\left((1-b)+b \frac{d l}{a v d l}\right)+t f_{i}}$$
where $q$ is the query.
1. In this part of the problem, we will consider how BM25 performs on the query "employee benefits". Below are some statistics for our corpus.
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
\hline Number of webpages & $1000$ \\
\hline Number of webpages containing "employee" & $10$ \\
\hline Number of webpages containing "benefits" & $100$ \\
\hline Average document length & $78$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

There are only two documents relevant to "employee benefits". Below are their statistics.
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline & benefits.pdf & welcome.pdf \\
\hline Document Length & $26$ & $39$ \\
\hline Frequency of "employee" & $3$ & $4$ \\
\hline Frequency of "benefits" & $3$ & $2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Let $k_{1}=1$ and $b=0.6$. Calculate the $R S V^{B M 25}$ for each document for the query "employee benefits".
(a) $[1 \mathrm{pt}] R S V_{\text {benefits.pdf }}$ :
(b) $[1 \mathrm{pt}] R S V_{\text {welcome.pdf }}$ :
2. Suppose our query has only one term, briefly answer in $1$ or $2$ sentences for each of the following questions on the effects of varying different parameters to the $R S V^{B M 25}$. Assuming all other parameters are fixed:
(a) $[2 \mathrm{pts}]$ What is the effect on $R S V^{B M 25}$ of varying $b$ from $0$ to $1$ ?
(b) [2pts] What is the effect on $R S V^{B M 25}$ when $t f_{i}$ goes to infinity?
(c) $[2 \mathrm{pts}]$ How would you manipulate the parameters $k_{1}$ and $b$ so that the $R S V^{B M 25}$ approximates TF-IDF? Justify your answer.

\section{$10$ Index Construction (12pts)}

Consider constructing a nonpositional index. Due to hardware constraints and the nature of each document collection, several indexing algorithms have been proposed, e.g., the blocked sort-based indexing (BSBI) algorithm, the single-pass in-memory indexing (SPIMI) algorithm, and dynamic indexing. In this exam question, we will test your understanding of various indexing algorithms.
1. Briefly answer in one sentence each of the below questions:
(a) [1pt] What hardware constraint does BSBI address?
(b) [1pt] What is the advantage of using termIDs instead of terms in BSBI?
(c) [1pt] What limitation of BSBI does SPIMI address?
(d) [1pt] When do we need to use dynamic indexing?
2. [3pts] In the text book (IIR Figure 4.4), only part of the SPIMI algorithm, the inversion procedure for each block, is described, not the entire algorithm.

Your task is to complete the SPIMI algorithm (in no more than $10$ lines of code), similar to the BSBI algorithm as detailed in IIR Figure $4.2$ or below.
```
BSBINDEXCONSTRUCTION()
    $n \leftarrow 0$
    while (all documents have not been processed)
    do $n \leftarrow n+1$
        block $\leftarrow$ ParsenextBlock ()
        BSBI-InVERT(block)
        WriteBlockToDisk (block, $f_{n}$ )
    $\operatorname{MERGEBLOCKS}\left(f_{1}, \ldots, f_{n} ; f_{\text {merged }}\right)$
```

For your convenience, you can:
- Call the function SPIMI-Invert(token_stream)
- Call any functions used in the BSBIndexConstruction algorithm above.
- View all documents in a collection as a single token_stream given by the function Get-Collection-Stream().
- Query the method Has_Next(token_stream) which will return False if the end of the collection has been reached.
3. [5pts] Now, apply the SPIMI algorithm to the following collection:
d1: bsbi use term id
d2: sort term id doc id
d3: spimi use term
d4: no term id sort
Assume that main memory can only hold two documents at a time, i.e., the SPIMI algorithm will write to disk each time after two documents, a block, have been processed.

Write out the content of each block just before merging and the result after merging in the following format:

Block 1:
bsbi $\rightarrow 1$
term $\rightarrow 1,2$
