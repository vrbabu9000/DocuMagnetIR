The previous version of the question read \"...For the given postings list, what is the upper limit on how much processing time (in $\\mu$ s per list element) variable byte encoding can take, in order to be faster than (or equally fast as) gamma encoding?\" The current version reads \"For the given postings list, what is the upper limit on how much processing time the decoding of variable byte encoding can take (in $\\mu$ s per list element), in order to be faster than (or equally fast as) gamma encoding on an overall basis (transfer + decoding)?\"\nThis problem set has $5$ problems. For some questions, you only need to write your answer as a number or a few characters; but you need to write a brief justification for your answer if the question requests you to do so. Please make sure that your answer is clear and succinct; we may not give full credits to answers that are overly long. After you finish this problem set, upload the PDF file with your answers to GradeScope.\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you finish this problem set individually. You can have general knowledge-level discussions with other students, but sharing answers is not allowed under the Honor Code. If you have questions or need clarifications, please post on Piazza or come to office hours.\n\n\\section{Problem $1$ - Positional Indexes (5 points)}\n\nConsider the following documents:\nDoc 1: I am a student, and I currently take CS276. I was a student in CS224N last quarter.\nDoc 2: I was a student. I have taken CS276.\na. We have seen that positional indexes are very useful to run queries and search against documents. Let's build positional indexes on top of these documents using the format $\\mathrm{DocID}_{\\mathrm{a}}$ : $<$ Position $_{\\mathrm{abc}}$, Position $_{\\mathrm{xyz}}>$; DocID $_{\\mathrm{b}}$ : $<$ Position $_{\\text {def }}$, Position $_{\\text {ghi }}>; \\ldots$\nThe position of the first word in the document is $1$, by convention.\nFor example, the positional index for the word \"am\" is as follows:\nam: $1:<2>$\nShow the positional indexes for the words \"I\" and \"CS276\".\nb. A phrase query \"word1 word2\" retrieves the occurrences where word1 is immediately followed by word2. A / $k$ query \"word1 $/ k$ word2\" ( $k$ is a positive integer) retrieves the occurrences of word1",

    "text": "\nwithin $k$ words of word2 on either side. For example, $k=1$ demands that word1 be adjacent to word2, but word1 may come either before or after word2.\n\nFor the following queries, return all the docs and corresponding positions for which the query conditions are met. To take a hypothetical example: if a two-word query matches words $3$ and $4$, as well as words $7$ and $8$ in document $2$, you should return the following:\n$2:<(3,4),(7,8)>$\nIf none of the documents meet the criteria, return None.\ni. \"I student\"\nii. \"student I\"\niii. \"I / $2$ student\"\niv. \"student / $2$ I\"\nc. Let's say we want to find documents in which \"I\" and \"CS276\" are at most $3$ words apart, but in the same sentence.\ni. How would you modify the positional index to support queries that demand the terms to be in the same sentence? You can assume that the parsing step is able to identify the sentences in a document.\nii. Write down an example of the modified postings list for the words \"I\" and \"CS276\".\n\n\\section{Problem $2$ - Dictionary Storage Compression (10 points)}\n\nSuppose the vocabulary for your inverted index consists of the following $6$ terms:\nelite\nelope\nellipse\neloquent\neligible\nelongate\na. Assume that the dictionary data structure used for this index stores the sorted list of terms using dictionary-as-a-string storage with front coding. Show the resulting storage of the above vocabulary of $6$ terms under two different block sizes:\ni. block size of $3$\nii. block size of $6$\n\nUse the special symbols * and $\\diamond$ as used in the discussion on front coding in Chapter $5$.\nb. Calculate the total dictionary storage (in bytes) required to store the vocabulary using:\ni. Fixed width entries of $20$ bytes",

    "text": "\nii. Blocked storage with front coding and a block size of $3$ (i.e., Problem $2$ (a) (i) above)\n\nBy what proportion do we reduce storage by using blocked storage with front coding and a block size of $3$ ?\n\nAssume that:\n- The dictionary stores the term, the document frequency, and a pointer to the postings list\n- The postings list pointer and the document frequency each occupy $4$ bytes\n- Each character can be stored in $1$ byte\n- For blocked storage, the term pointer occupies $3$ bytes\nc. Suppose the above vocabulary was only a snippet of a larger vocabulary. What is the maximum size of the vocabulary that can be resolved using $3$ byte term pointers? Assume that each vocabulary entry is $8$ characters long on average, and that blocked storage with front coding compression method compressing the dictionary string by $20 \\%$. Show your calculations.\n\n\\section{Problem $3$ - Postings Compression (8 points)}\n\nConsider a postings list:\n$$<4,15,62,63,265,267,270,501>$$\nwith the corresponding list of document gaps:\n$$<4,11,47,1,202,2,3,231>$$\n\nAssume that the length of the postings list is stored separately, so the system knows when a postings list is complete. We are going to contrast the size and speed tradeoffs of using variable byte encoding with gamma encoding.\na. Encode the document gaps using variable byte encoding.\nb. Encode the document gaps using gamma encoding.\nc. Assuming a slow ethernet connection (1 million bytes / second) to network attached storage, how long would it take to transfer just the given postings list stored in variable byte encoding (of document gaps) to memory? How about the gamma encoded list? (Answer in $\\mu \\mathrm{s}=10^{-6}$ seconds.) Note: Do not pad the transmitted pad to the byte boundary.\nd. Now, assume that to decode a gamma encoded postings list into usable numbers takes a constant time of $n / 2 \\mu$ s where $n$ is the number of elements in the postings list. This adds an additional processing time to decode the posting list stored in gamma encoded format to documents gap integers. For the given postings list, what is the upper limit on how much processing time the decoding of variable byte encoding can take (in $\\mu$ s per list element), in order to be faster than (or equally fast as) gamma encoding on an overall basis (transfer + decoding)?",
