Syllabus<br>Computer Science $600.435$<br>Artificial Intelligence<br>Spring, $2017$<br>( $3$ credits, EQ)

## 1. Description

The course situates the study of Artificial Intelligence (AI) first in the broader context of Philosophy of Mind and Cognitive Psychology and then treats in-depth methods for automated reasoning, automatic problem solvers and planners, knowledge representation mechanisms, game playing, machine learning, and statistical pattern recognition. The class is a recommended for all scientists and engineers with a genuine curiosity about the fundamental obstacles to getting machines to perform tasks such as deduction, learning, and planning and navigation. Strong programming skills and a good grasp of the English language are expected; students will be asked to complete both programming assignments and writing assignments. The course will include a brief introduction to scientific writing and experimental design, including assignments to apply these concepts.

Course Expectations \& Grading
Grading is based on four homework assignments and one final exam.

## 10. Assignments \& Readings

Readings are announced on the course web site for each lecture. Students are expected to read the material before coming to class.
There will be four assignments:

- Essay on portrayal of artificial intelligence in a literary or audio-visual work
- Game playing
- Logic and Knowledge engineering
- Machine learning

The detailed requirements for these assignments will be announced on the course web site. Late submission penalty is $10 \%$ of the grade per day.

## 11. Ethics

The strength of the university depends on academic and personal integrity. In this course, you must be honest and truthful, abiding by the Computer Science Academic Integrity Policy:

Cheating is wrong. Cheating hurts our community by undermining academic integrity, creating mistrust, and fostering unfair competition. The university will punish cheaters with failure on an assignment, failure in a course, permanent transcript notation, suspension, and/or expulsion. Offenses may be reported to medical, law or other professional or graduate schools when a cheater applies.

Violations can include cheating on exams, plagiarism, reuse of assignments without permission, improper use of the Internet and electronic devices, unauthorized collaboration, alteration of graded assignments, forgery and falsification, lying, facilitating academic dishonesty, and unfair competition. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse.

Academic honesty is required in all work you submit to be graded. Except where the instructor specifies group work, you must solve all homework and programming assignments without the help of others. For example, you must not look at anyone else.s solutions (including program code) to your homework problems. However, you may discuss assignment specifications (not solutions) with others to be sure you understand what is required by the assignment.

If your instructor permits using fragments of source code from outside sources, such as your textbook or on-line resources, you must properly cite the source. Not citing it constitutes plagiarism. Similarly, your group projects must list everyone who participated.

Falsifying program output or results is prohibited.
Your instructor is free to override parts of this policy for particular assignments. To protect yourself: (1) Ask the instructor if you are not sure what is permissible. (2) Seek help from the instructor, TA or CAs, as you are always encouraged to do, rather than from other students. (3) Cite any questionable sources of help you may have received.

On every exam, you will sign the following pledge: "I agree to complete this exam without unauthorized assistance from any person, materials or device. [Signed and dated]". Your course instructors will let you know where to find copies of old exams, if they are available.
Report any violations you witness to the instructor.
