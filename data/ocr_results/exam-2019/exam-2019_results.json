If one question is taking too long, it may be worth moving on and coming back to the problem question(s) after the rest of the exam is complete.\n- Remember that you are only allowed one sheet (both sides) of notes, everything else besides that and the test itself must be off of your workspace.\n- Please show ALL relevant work for your answers and provide explanations when prompted. Failure to do either will result in loss of credit.\n- You will have until $5 \\mathrm{pm}$ to complete this test.",
