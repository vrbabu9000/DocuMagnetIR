We will not grade answers on scratch paper or the back pages of the exam that are unnumbered.\n- Make sure that your answers are legible and your handwriting is dark. We will be scanning the exams and grading them using Gradescope.\n- Be sure to show your work on all problems in order to allow for partial credit.",
